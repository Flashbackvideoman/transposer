  As Tears Go By
  by The Rolling Stones
  
  [Intro] 
  G    A7    C    D7
  
  [Verse 1]
  G           A7             C    D7
    It is the evening of the da - ay.
  G           A7                 C     D7
    I sit and watch the children pla - ay.
  C               D7         G     D       Em Em7
    Smiling faces I can see,   but not for me.
  C                    Bm    C  D7
    I sit and watch as tears go by.
